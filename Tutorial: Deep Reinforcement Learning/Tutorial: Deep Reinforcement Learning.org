* Reinforcement Learning in a nutshell
** Reinforcement Learning in a nutshell
*** RL is a general-purpose framework for decision-making
- RL is for an *agent* with the capacity to *act*
- Each *action* influences the agentâ€™s future *state*
- Success is measured by a scalar *reward* signal
- Goal: *select actions to maximise future reward*
** Reinforcement Learning in a nutshell
*** DL is a general-purpose framework for representation learning
- Given an *objective*
- Learn *representation* that is required to achieve objective
- Directly from *raw inputs*
- Using minimal domain knowledge
* Deep Reinforcemnet Learning: AI = RL + DL
** Deep Reinforcement Learning: AI = RL + DL
*** We seek a single agent which can solve any human-level task
- RL defines the objective
- DL gives the mechanism
- RL + DL = general intelligence
* Introduction to Deep Learning
** Deep Representations
- A *deep representation* is a composition of many functions

** Deep Representations
- Its gradient can be *backpropagated* by the chain rule
